## Food

Each day, an adventurer is required to eat one day's worth
of rations. The specifics are left to the DM. If they fail
to eat, they gain one level of fatigue.

## Rests

For every day an adventurer does not use the *short rest*
feature, they gain one level of fatigue.

### Short rests

*These lands are perilous, it is fairly uncommon for the knight to close an eye*

Short rests require at least 8h to complete. Camping for the
night or sleeping at an inn are typically considered short
rests. During a short rest, an adventurer may spend hit die
to heal.  

Spending at least 2 hit die removes one level of
fatigue (note that spending more hit die does not remove
extra levels).

**For Spellcasters**: For every hit dice used, roll a d4. You gain half of the
number rolled (rounded up) in spell slots, starting from the lowest level and
going up.

> [!NOTE] Summary
> On a short rest you gain (`XdH` = hit dice used):
> - **NEW**: `(XdH)/2` (rounded down) in spell slots, starting from the lowest level.
> - **if** you use at least `2dH`,  `-1` fatigue  (does not stack).
> - `XdH` in healing.


### Long rests

Long rests require a week to complete. A long rest can be
broken up by menial tasks that do not require intense
physical or mental labor without canceling its effects.
Becoming staggered or foraging for food cancels the long
rest. 

At the end of the long rest, you regain 4 hit die, you
remove a level of fatigue and heal an amount equal to the
hit die regained. For example, if your hit dice is a `d8`, you
gain `4d8` hit die as well as heal for `4d8`.

Each day of the long rest is considered a short rest,
meaning you can consume hit die and remove fatigue levels
(see [[#Short rests]]). The usual [[#Food]] rules apply.
There is also nothing stopping adventurers from taking
consecutive short or long rests.

> [!NOTE] Summary
> At the end of a long rest you gain the following benefits:
> - `4dH` hit die
> - `4dH` hit die in healing
> - `-1` fatigue

### Bond

Every short or long rest, spending time with an ally has a 1:2 chance of
relieving 1 of their insanity levels. You can only use this feature once per
short rest, with one ally. If you are using this feature, others cannot bond
with you.

### Rest interruptions 

*The cold grasp of death lingered on the knight's throat as
she fell into a shallow slumber. Her brief rest, however,
was swiftly interrupted...*

Interrupted rests do not count as rests, they do no remove
fatigue levels and grant one level of fatigue, no matter how
many hit die were used. However, they still grant health on
hit dice used.

Short or long rests in designated safe areas (such as an
Inn, but these are determined by the DM) cannot be
interrupted by random encounters. The safety level of an
area is determined by the DM (eg. an area might just be safe
enough for a brief rest, but not safe for a week long one)

#### Random encounters

Every rest (unless in an area that is safe for the rest's
duration) the players or DM roll a  `d4`. Depending on how
hostile the area is, rolling below a certain number triggers
a random encounter that interrupts the players' rest (eg.
rolling below 4 in a mostly hostile area could trigger an
encounter, while the same effect would be tied to rolling
below 2 in a mostly safe area). The exact encounter is
determined by the DM. This book does not include these
encounters, as it is recommended to tailor them to your
campaign, setting, context and players, however, you can
take any of these encounters as an example.

##### Mad peasants ambush

The players are awakened by an ambush of madmen, here to
steal, kill and so on. They orchestrate an elaborate trap.
Some of the players could wake up tied and unable to move.
Some of the peasants could be hiding away in a bush, waiting
for the perfect moment to backstab. The peasants could keep
a high ground advantage, pushing a massive object such as a
boulder from a tree or small hill, crushing one or more
players.

##### Weird stranger 

A weird stranger emerges from the darkness. Be it a
wandering bard or merchant, a hunter or a nobleman, they
would act peaceful towards the players. The stranger could
either remain peaceful for the encounter, not counting as an
interrupt (this could happen if the roll was on a safe
number, but you want to keep the players guessing) or they
could plan to assassinate the players, call for
reinforcements, become possessed, show their true identity
as a vile creature or whatever else.
