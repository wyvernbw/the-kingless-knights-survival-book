The flow of combat outlined within the Survival Book is similar to the one found
in D&D 5th edition, with a few important changes.

Let's go through an example to see what combat might look like.

## Initiative

*As the baron loses his patience he swiftly orders: "Seize them! And have 'em flayed in the town square for all to see!"* 

Roll for initiative.

### Party based initiative

Initiative in the Kingless system works in a party order. This means that all
the creatures in a group or faction have their turn at the same time. Hence,
players can have their turns in any order they wish. This means they can take
their turn when they have decided what to do on their turn, eliminating
downtime. Consider implementing a turn timer to amplify the tension. Also,
**consider resolving damage and saves at the end of the round, as to not make
other already prepared players wait for dice rolls before they can declare their
intentions.** Similarly, the GM can take the NPCs and monsters' turn in whatever
order they choose.

### Determining party order

We previously established that characters within a party take their turns in
whatever order they choose. But in what order do **the parties** take their
turns? 

To determine the party-wide initiative, each player must roll an
initiative check. Their party's initiative value is equal to the highest score
rolled. Similarly, the DM rolls an initiative for every monster and chooses the
highest one. Alternatively, he could use the average initiative of the group plus
a flat bonus depending on encounter difficulty. The party initiative scores are
then compared, and the higher goes first.

## Attacks & Actions

The Survival Book offers a completely new attacking system (See [[Combat Options]]). Other actions are largely the same.
## 0 HP

*The jailer's broadsword swings down through your shoulder and clavicle, smashing your bones and you find yourself covered in your own, warm blood. You kneel, but the adrenaline keeps you from fainting, you briefly ignore pain and feel light as a feather.*

When a character reaches 0HP, they do **not** fall unconscious. Instead, they become **staggered**. 

### Staggered

A staggered character lost their footing within the fight, inching closer and
closer to death, but they are still conscious. Within this state, the
character's move speed is halved and it has disadvantage on any dexterity check.
The creature can attack and take actions as normal.

While in this state, the creature's HP can become negative and any attack made
against the creature is an automatic Critical Hit (see [[Combat Changes#Critical
Hits]]). The creature can then choose to stay awake and receive 1 level of
exhaustion (see [[Combat Changes#Exhaustion]]) or fall unconscious. If the
creature reaches the negative value of their maximum HP, they fall unconscious. 

An unconscious creature rolls death saves as usual. 

#### Healing while staggered

A successful medicine check can allow the creature to fall unconscious without
having to roll death saves. While asleep, the creature takes a forced short
rest, provided they are not interrupted. If they are attacked while in this
state, they lose all healing received through this rest and must roll death
saves.

Receiving magical healing puts a staggered creature at 1 HP and ends the stagger.

## Death Saves

Death saves work like normal.

### Variant death saves rule

Death saves do not regenerate and each creature has 3 + their constitution modifier (at least 1) saves.

### Death

*And the terrified knight draws his last breath.*

**Character death is permanent.** 

Any resurrection spells require the caster to both:
- 1. have personally known the dead creature
- 2. sacrifice their own life
