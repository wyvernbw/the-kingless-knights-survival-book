## Weapons

### Melee

Also see [[Combat Options#Stance Actions]].

(Changed) **Longsword** 
- (Removed) Sap
- (New) **Half-swording** `Stance Action (1 slot)` 
	- You stab through the gaps in an opponent's armor. Make an attack against the
	target as if their AC was decreased by 2 (up to 10). On a hit, decrease the
	target's AC by 2 (up to 10).

(Changed) **Greataxe**
- (New) **Helm-splitter** `Stance Action (2 slots)`:
	- You charge your attack for a turn. Roll a `d12`. You can charge for up to 3
	consecutive turns. Failing to charge cancels Helm-splitter and the stance slots
	are lost.
	-  If you charged for at least one turn, you can attack. Make an attack with
	disadvantage. On a miss, if the target is wearing armor, it gains an additional
	weak spot at the number rolled. On a hit, add all the rolled die (from
	charging) to the damage.
	- A creature with a weak spot gained from helm-splitter cannot receive another
	one. The weak spot is cleared if and only if the creature changes armor.

(Changed) **Greatsword**
- (Removed) Graze
- (New) range: 10 ft.
- (New) Cannot be parried by non-heavy weapons.
- (New) **Cleave**
- (New) **Man-splitter** `Stance action (1 slot)`:
	- Can be activated after attacking.
	- On a critical hit, double the damage.
	- If a creature remains below 15 health, it dies (unless using non-lethal damage)
