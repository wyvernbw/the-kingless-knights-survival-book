## Weapons

### Melee

Also see [[Combat Options#Stance Actions]].

(Changed) **Longsword** 
- (Removed) Sap
- (New) **Half-swording** `Stance Action (1 slot)` 
	- You stab through the gaps in an opponent's armor. Make an attack against the
	target as if their AC was decreased by 2 (up to 10). On a hit, decrease the
	target's AC by 2 (up to 10).

(Changed) **Greataxe**
- (New) **Helm-splitter** `Stance Action (2 slots)`:
	- You charge your attack for a turn. Roll a `d12`. You can charge for up to 3
	consecutive turns. Failing to charge cancels Helm-splitter and the stance slots
	are lost.
	- Charging works like concentration, but you make a constitution saving throw
	when you take damage instead.
	-  If you charged for at least one turn, you can attack. Make an attack with
	disadvantage. On a miss, if the target is wearing armor, it gains an additional
	weak spot at the number rolled. On a hit, add all the rolled die (from
	charging) to the damage.
	- A creature with a weak spot gained from helm-splitter cannot receive another
	one. The weak spot is cleared if and only if the creature changes armor.

(Changed) **Greatsword**
- (Removed) Graze
- (New) range: 10 ft.
- (New) Cannot be parried by non-heavy weapons.
- (New) **Cleave**
- (New) **Man-splitter** `Stance action (3 slots)`:
	- Can be activated after attacking.
	- On a critical hit, double the damage.
	- If a creature remains below 15 health, it dies (unless using non-lethal damage) 

(Changed) **Dagger**
- (Changed) **Nick**: can attack with the same weapon
- (New) Stab wounds
	- Hitting a target with a dagger twice in the same turn deals 1d8 bleed instead of 1d4
- (New) **Needle stab** `Stance action (2 slot)`:
	- Counts as two hits for the purpose of *Stab wounds*
	- Your next attack ignores armor that is medium or heavy. (refer to armor AC
	table)

(Changed) **Javelin**
- (New) **Volley** `Stance action (1 slot)`
	- Throwing the javelin allows you to throw another as a bonus action.
	- Cannot be used with 0 slots.
	- Can be repeated in the same turn as long as you have slots (throwing the
	second javelin does not require a bonus action on subsequent uses).

(Changed) **Light hammer**
